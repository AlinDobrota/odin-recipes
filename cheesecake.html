  <h1>Cheesecake San Sebastian</h1>

  <p>

    It is stunning to see with it s mahogany brown top and oozy, custardy center.
    This Basque Burnt Cheesecake is unlike any you ve ever tasted.

  <p>
    Sebastian is known as the best place to eat in Europe.
    After a recent family trip to that lovely city on the Bay of
    Biscay, I wouldn t argue with that statement.
    San Sebastian is famous for Pinxtos (Basque for tapas) and this unique cheesecake

  <h2>What is a San Sebastian Cheesecake?</h2>
  <p>
    San Sebastian Cheesecake is also called Basque Burnt Cheesecake
  </p>

  <p>
    This cheesecake is different from American cheesecake in pretty much every way
    you can think of. The recipe starts with 2# of cream cheese, as many cheesecakes do,
    but from there it gets really weird.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This recipe has more eggs than a typical cheesecake recipe.</li>
    <li>There are no flavorings like vanilla or lemon and there’s a little more salt than usual.</li>
    <li>The batter is not made with a mixer (it can be though), but is made in a food processor. You simply chuck in all
      the ingredients into the processor and give it a whirl. Couldn’t be easier to mix this batter</li>
    <li>There is no crust on the cheesecake.</li>
    <li>The batter is baked in a parchment lined spring form pan.</li>
    <li>The cake is not baked in a water bath.</li>
    <li>The weirdest part of this recipe, the cake is put into a screaming-hot
      oven and bakes in just 25 minutes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>This recipe is adapted from the original Basque Burnt Cheesecake recipe:</h2>
  <p>
    I ve seen a bunch of recipes on the interwebs that call themselves San Sebastian Cheesecake or Basque Cheesecake
    but most of them didn’t look quite right to me.</p>
  <p>
    Some of the recipes added flour and buttered the pan instead of lining it with parchment. Those cakes were pretty
    and sliced into a perfect standing wedge. But that’s not what we ate in San Sebastian.
  </p>
  The original cake we enjoyed at the famous La Vina Pinxo Bar was oozy, custardy and tasted like eggs. It’s nothing
  like an American cheesecake, which is why it was so fun to taste.
  <p>
    This recipe was adapted from one I found on line which is reportedly the La Vina original. Apparently the chef puts
    it out there to share with the world. How generous is that!
